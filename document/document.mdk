#Introduction

## Our question

Many logics have been studied under  Curry -- Howard interpretation

* Intuitionistic : STLC
* Linear : Various resource sensitive typed calculi -- e.g. session types, concurrent programming
* Modal logics: Focus on $S4$ -- calculi for staged computation, modal type theories etc.

What is a sensible Curry Howard reading/ calculus of justificaton logic based on first principles?



## Which Justification Logic?

  * Justification logic is a multifaceted system of necessity
  * Can be configured to emulate $K$, $T$, $S4$, $S5$ modality
  * Can appear in intuitionistic and classical versions with respect to the underlying logic 
  * We focus on a minimal system based on $K$ modal logic and intuitionistic implication
  * Strengthening of the modality can be done in a way  that is respecting the computational reading we propose

## Motivation


  * Justification logic stemmed from Artemov's solution to providing an explicit proof theoretic semantics classical
  to intuionistic logic.
  * We treat justifications as __validations__. I.e. second level proof constructs 
  in a trusted system that are to be related with proof constructs of another weaker system in the first level (take classical/ intuitionistic constructs as an exemplary case)
  * We, effectively, treat __proof theoretically__ a pretty basic __semantical__ idea.    

~ Slide
  * This concept is definitely not new: it appears in the categorical setting in the work of Lawvere with
  concepts such as ``semantics as functors" or  "adjunctions between syntax and semantics".
  * We build a logic closer to the former but the latter approach is open for furture  work
  * Other adjunction or monadic based logics have been developed based on this insights (e.g. Moggi's lax calculus)
  * Our novel  contribution is the relation to justification logic which is an existing well studied
  logic in itself.

## Motivation (formally) 

Assume a deductive systems $I$:

  * with propositions in $U_I$
  * a possibly non-empty signature of axioms $\Sigma_I$    
  * an entailment relation   $\Sigma_I;\Gamma\vdash_{I}A$
   

and  $J$ with: $U_J$, $\Sigma_J$, and $\Sigma_J;\Delta\vdash_J \phi$ respectively.  

## Motivation(formally)
Minimal requirements:

* __Reflexivity__ :
    
    * $A \in \Gamma \Longrightarrow \Gamma\vdash_{I}A$
    * $\phi \in \Delta \Longrightarrow \Delta\vdash_{J}\phi$
* __Compositionality__:  
    * $\Gamma\vdash_I A$ __and__ $\Gamma^{\prime},A\vdash_{I} B \Longrightarrow \Gamma,\Gamma^{\prime}\vdash_I B $  
    * $\Delta\vdash_J\phi$ __and__ $\Delta^{\prime},\phi\vdash_{J} \psi \Longrightarrow \Delta,\Delta^{\prime}\vdash_J \psi$ 
*  __Top __:
 $\Gamma\vdash_{I}\top_I \text{\ and \ }
	\Delta \vdash_J\top_J$
* __Structural interpretation of contexts__: 
  For $\Gamma$ of  the form $A_1,\ldots, A_n$:
  
  $\llbracket\Gamma \rrbracket=\llbracket A_1  \rrbracket,\ldots,  \llbracket A_n\rrbracket$
  
~ Slide
Given a deductive system $I$  and an  interpretation $\llbracket\bullet\rrbracket_J$ for $I$ we define:
a _corresponding validation_ of a deduction $\Sigma_I;\Gamma\vdash_I A$  
as a deduction $\Sigma_J;\Delta\vdash_{J} \phi$ in $J$ such that $\llbracket A \rrbracket=\phi$ and $\Delta=\llbracket \Gamma \rrbracket $ . We will be writing
$ \llbracket \Sigma_I;\Gamma\vdash_I A\rrbracket_J$ to denote such a validation.
